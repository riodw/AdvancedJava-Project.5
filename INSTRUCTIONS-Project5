Design an aquarium with several fish of different colors moving in it. Your aquarium should be a window with water color background. Your moving fish should be implemented by using different threads.  Your fish should move in the aquarium until the user closes the window. The fish shape can be defined by using the Polygon class and the fish color can be drawn by using the fillPolygon method from the Graphics class. The constructor of the Polygon class takes three parameters: int [] x, int [] y, and int n. The first array parameter should contain all the x coordinates of the corner points of the polygon, the second array parameter should contain all the corresponding y coordinates in order of the corner points, and the third parameter is the number of corner points. The fillPolygon method has a Polygon type parameter.
1.	Donâ€™t forget to include professional documentation and appropriate indentation.
2.	Each fish uses a thread. Use one class to define Fish with coordinates and Color attributes so you may make different fish by giving different coordinates and colors.
